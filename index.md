## Introduction

The lab course serves as a supplement to the machine learning class taught in MT 2023, with the following objectives:

1. By implementation, reviewing concepts from the theoretical content covered in the previous term.
2. Develop intuition about how algorithmic designs affect testing performance.
3. Gaining a basic familiarity with commonly used Python packages such as sklearn, numpy, and pytorch.

### Course format and platform

We will start with a short introduction and then the students do coding. We will use [[google colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/) as a platform for exercises.  
                
## Instructors

- Instructor: Dr. Yangchen Pan (Email: yangchen.eng.ox@gmail.com)
- TAs: TBD

## Course Policy

### Grading and Attendance

Before leaving, please ask the instructor or TAs to review your completed exercises. After that, please sign the attendance sheet.

**Discussion is encouraged. The right answer comes from yourself.**

Students should go to the assigned session unless officially justified evidence is provided (e.g., doctor's note). 

### ChatGPTs are not allowed for coding. 

### Time/Break

Lab runs from 11:00 am - 5:00 pm, Software Lab B.

Lunch break: 12:45 pm - 2:00 pm

## Content

We will use [[google colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/) as a platform for exercises. Sufficient hint/code will be provided in the colab file for each option. 

**NOTE 1: for each colab file below, you should make a copy in your own google drive to edit & run.**

**NOTE 2: the content is not good to use before your session officially starts, as there might be last-minute updates.**

**NOTE 3: feel free to google offcial docs of some functions when needed.**
