## Introduction

The lab course serves as a supplement to the theoretical part of machine learning class, with the following objectives:

1. By implementation, reviewing concepts from the theoretical content covered in the previous term.
2. Develop intuition about how algorithmic designs affect testing performance.
3. Gaining a basic familiarity with commonly used Python packages such as sklearn, numpy, and pytorch.

### Course format and platform

The students do coding. We will use [[google colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/) as a platform for exercises.  
                
## Instructors

- Instructor: Dr. PAN, Yangchen (Email: yangchen.eng.ox@gmail.com)
- TAs: Alasdair Paren; Zhiyao Luo. 

## Course Policy

### Grading and Attendance

1. Before leaving, please ask the instructor or TAs to review your completed exercises. After that, please sign the attendance sheet. If you are unable to complete it on time, you may email me (yangchen.eng.ox@gmail.com) no later than 5 p.m. the following day, using the email subject: Yourname-SessionDate-mllab2024.

2. **Discussion is encouraged. The right answer comes from yourself.**

3. Students should go to the assigned session unless officially justified evidence is provided (e.g., doctor's note). 

### ChatGPTs are not allowed for coding. 

### Time/Break

Lab runs from 11:00 am - 5:00 pm, Software Lab B.

Lunch break: 12:45 pm - 2:00 pm

## Content

We will use [[google colab]](https://colab.research.google.com/) as a platform for exercises. Sufficient hint/code will be provided in the colab file for each option. 

**Suggestions on how to approach the exercises:** Avoid spending too much time on a single question. Aim to complete as many questions as you can initially, and then return to the ones you found challenging. The exercises are designed to be (mostly) self-contained, serving as a tutorial. For example, you should be able to learn how to define/train a simple neural network in PyTorch by examining the provided code. Feel free to consult the official documentation for some functions if necessary. We encourage you to try solving problems on your own first, but we are always here to help if you need it. 

**NOTE 1: for each colab file below, you should make a copy in your own google drive to edit & run.**

**NOTE 2: the content is not good to use before your session officially starts, as there might be last-minute updates.**
